# Scheduler
---
This repo is an experiment to create a scheduler in scala.
We use Scala Future to run the scheduler to run the scheduler task on a seperate thread in non-blocking manner, so that overall program run in non blocking fashion.

# Key Feature
---
We use FastParse library to extract the time information from String.
The choice of string is deliberate, as strings are common across different application/programming language.

# Usage
---
Refer to Main.scala for usage.

#### Any improvements are most welcome !!!
